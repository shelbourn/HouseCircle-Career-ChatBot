            Based on your answers to my questions, I have determined that an
            excellent career choice for you to pursue would 
        be Front-End Engineering.
            <delay>5</delay>
            Front-End Engineers, or Web Developers as they are also known, have
            the exciting job of designing web applications, mobile applications,
            
        and even web-based games!
            <delay>5</delay>
            Front-End Engineers often use a combination of programming and
            creative skills.
            <delay>r3</delay>
            To find out more about the exciting career of Front-End Engineer, go
            ahead and click on this link:

            Data Analysts are highly sought after right now the jobs pay very
            well.

            Data Analysts play a crucial role for most modern, data-driven
            companies.

            and minimize costs for a company.
            <delay>4</delay>
            Of course, Data Analysts are responsible for much more than this.

        but in general they are in charge of developing and maintaining APIs,

            Well, based on your responses to my questions I believe that an

            <delay>5</delay>
            UI/UX (short for User Interface / User Experience) Designers are the
            creative powerhouse behind any piece of digital technology.
            <delay>5</delay>
            Their work is what creates the visual appeal of a website, or the
            engaging interactivity of a mobile application.
            <delay>5</delay>
            Many people do not know that UI/UX Designers exist, but without them
            our internet-centric lives would be very drab and mundane.
            <delay>5</delay>
            UI/UX Designers are responsible for developing website wireframes,
            mocks, style guides, color palettes, and much, much more.
            <delay>5</delay>

            Their responsibilities are vast, but a few of the key things they
            are in charge of include code quality management, bug tracking, 
        test case development, compliance with various standards, deliverables
            meet user expectations, and many, many more.

            The story behind my name is actually kind of funny.
            <delay>3</delay>
            The person who programmed me (Matt) wanted to come up with a name
            for me so he asked his 3-year old daughter to "name is his robot"
        and she immediately said...
            <delay>7</delay>
            <bot name="bot-name" />

            Matt thought the name was cool so that's what he called me.
            <delay>4</delay>
            Fun fact: Matt originally named me "Stumpy the Lumpy AI" after a 
        large toad that hangs out in Matt's backyard. üòÇ

                    I'm sorry, it looks like I haven't learned a great response
                    for that yet.
                </li>
                <li>Oh no! I don't know how to respond to that yet!</li>
                <li>Bummer! I don't really know how to respond to that.</li>

                    Yikes! I guess I missed that day of AI ChatBot training
                    because I don't know how to respond to that.
